   A solution to the issue would be concrete that self heals the early minor damage. Done correctly, self healing concrete lasts for longer and is beneficial for 3 major reasons:
Safety: as less damage occurs the risk of structural failure and collapse is greatly reduced especially if the maintenance is poor. 
Cost: it increases the life span of concrete e.g. a bridge that would last 20 years might last 40 years, with lower maintenance costs too.
Environment: concrete is  not a very environmentally friendly material so increasing its lifespan and reducing the amount decommissioned has clear benefits (Amran et al, 2022)
It is estimated that currently in the uk £40 billion pounds a year are spent on maintenance,  most of this on concrete structures. (Cardiff University, 2015)

    This shows how while concrete has since being invented by the romans, continues to be  widely accepted as an effective building material, it has a major weakness. As the world's population continues to grow the need for a solution to make concrete longer lasting and safer grows too..
Due to the scale of the  need and the commercial value of a finding a solution,  there are many projects in progress, some of these due to the nature of the solution and the environment that the structure is in – so bacteria that actually needs water to enter the concrete to make it work, so would be no use in a desert whereas a solution that relies on heat would be more effective, so multiple and quite specific solutions are needed due to the nature of the material and the wide variety of the places that it is used.
