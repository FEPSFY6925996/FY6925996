  Concrete is used globally as building material due to its many advantages; however, it does suffer from structural wear issues that make it prone to cracking and with its low tensile strength - subsequent expensive or potentially dangerous failure. This document outlines the history and current developments of self-healing concrete as a solution to this challenge.  Including the use of polymers, vascular systems and bacteria. It details some trials of new solutions, along with some of a currently commercially available one. It will outline that in the context of a growing world population creating ever increasing demand where, the importance of the cost, safety and environmental benefits that these solutions can deliver.

<h3 id="The Problem">The Problem</h3>  
  <p id="TheProblem_InText">
  Concrete has a low tensile strength this means it cracks easily in comparison to other building materials. <a href="#References">(Valli & Kumar, 2023)</a> 
<br>
<br>
These cracks can lead to wider damage in the concrete, as they can allow the ingress of water and gases to reach the steel reinforcements which can result in major damage and then structural failure. <a href="#References">(Sabouni 2023)</a>. this is show in figure 1 <a href="#References">(Valli & Kumar, 2023)</a>.
<br>
<br>
This leads to a constant need to monitor the minor damage and its risk of leading to structural damage, which if not done correctly can lead to catastrophic failure or the need to re-build early <a href="#References">(Valli & Kumar, 2023)</a>

<h3 id="Soluction - self healing concrete">Soluction - self healing concrete</h3>

  <p id="Soluctionselfhealingconcrete_InText"> 
A solution to the issue would be concrete that self heals the early minor damage. Done correctly, self healing concrete lasts for longer and is beneficial for 3 major reasons:
<br>   
<br> 
Safety: as less damage occurs the risk of structural failure and collapse is greatly reduced especially if the maintenance is poor. 
<br>
<br>
Cost: it increases the life span of concrete e.g. a bridge that would last 20 years might last 40 years, with lower maintenance costs too.
<br>
<br>
Environment: concrete is  not a very environmentally friendly material so increasing its lifespan and reducing the amount decommissioned has clear benefits <a href="#References">(Amran et al, 2022)</a>
<br>
<br>
"It is estimated that currently in the uk £40 billion pounds a year are spent on maintenance,  most of this on concrete structures." <a href="#References">Cardiff University, 2015</a>.

<h3 id="History">History</h3>  
  <p id="History_InText"> 
The concept  of self healing concrete is not completely new. 
<br>
<br>
The Romans used a type of lime mortar in the concrete that self-heals, along the cracks stratlingite crystals form and bind the aggregate and mortar back together. This process is still going on today nearly 2000 years later. Geologist Marie Jackson and her colleagues discovered this in 2014. <a href="#References">(Jackson et al, 2014)</a>
<br>
<br>
Carolyn M. Dry created the first modern self-healing concrete in the early 1990s. This used chemicals released from fibers that were imbedded into the cementitious matrix.<a href="#References">(Dry, 2020)</a>

There is a lot of research going into self healing concrete as the benefits are so great.
<br>
<br>
Researchers are looking at a number of options including capsules, vascular systems and bacteria. Figure 2 shows some of these methods <a href="#References">(Amran et al, 2022)</a>.
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
The following give some examples
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>A project lead by Cardiff University involves 3 processes which they ultimately hope to combine together.</h3>
<p id="CurrentResearch2">
The tests for the project is being carried out on the A465 construction project. They have cast 6 concrete walls at the site each containing a different system which they are going to load at different angles to induce cracks which they will monitor.  As shown in figure 3.
<br>
<br>    
The first technique : uses shape-memory polymers that when heated return to a shape they have memorised this will be used to repair large cracks or make them smaller. 
<br>
<br>
The second technique: this involves pumping organic and inorganic healing agents through a series of thin vascular tubes to help repair damage.
<br>
<br>
The third technique: tiny capsules and/or lightweight aggregates that contain both bacteria and healing agents into the concrete. Once cracks form the capsules will release their loads, the bacteria will feed on the nutrients this allow them to produce calcium carbonates that will heal the cracks in the concrete.
<br>
<br>
“Professor Bob Lark, the principal investigator on the project from Cardiff University’s 
School of Engineering, said: “Our vision is to create sustainable and resilient systems 
that continually monitor, regulate, adapt and repair themselves without the need for 
human intervention.” <a href="#References">Cardiff University, 2015</a>.

<h3>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s Technique</h3>
<p id="CurrentResearch3">
This technique is being designed mostly for large infrastructure projects and in scenarios which feature high pressures and temperatures. 

<br>
<br>
The cement contains polymers. This polymer has two properties, one  it increases the  strength by distributing the stresses  throughout the whole structure (a teat for this is shown in figure 4) and two  when a crack forms it helps bond it back together again, further it is able to repeat this healing process multiple times.
<br>
<br>
They think it will extend the life of a concrete structure by 30 to 50 years <a href="#References">(PNNL no date)</a>

<h3> Sensicon’s Product is on the market and is called Sensicrete</h3> 
<p id="CurrentResearch4">
Sensicrete invented by Henk Jonkers, it is designed to be used in structures that can gain water damage e.g. sea defence walls. It is made of standard concrete mixed with the self-healing agent. The process uses bacteria that once exposed to water will activate as the concrete cracks, allowing water to enter will produce limestone and seal the cracks this process is shown in figure 5. <a href="#References">(sensicon)</a>.

 <h3 id="Summary">Summary</h3> 
  <p id="Summary_InText"> 
This shows how while concrete has since being invented by the romans, continues to be  widely accepted as an effective building material, it has a major weakness. As the world's population continues to grow the need for a solution to make concrete longer lasting and safer grows too..
Due to the scale of the  need and the commercial value of a finding a solution,  there are many projects in progress, some of these due to the nature of the solution and the environment that the structure is in – so bacteria that actually needs water to enter the concrete to make it work, so would be no use in a desert whereas a solution that relies on heat would be more effective, so multiple and quite specific solutions are needed due to the nature of the material and the wide variety of the places that it is used.
